# 👋 Hi there, I'm Fatmeh!

- 🎓 I'm a Software Engineering Student at Braude Academic College (Graduating March 2026).  
- 📚 Starting next semester, I’ll also be pursuing a Teaching Certificate in Computer Science.
- 🎨 I have a strong interest in visual communication and user-facing design, particularly in creating clear, well-structured presentations and interfaces.
- 💡 I'm still exploring what I'm truly passionate about, but I'm driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and learning how things work.
